> Model

- Model predicts number of request based on time series data. 
- Models available are:
    - ARIMA
    - SARIMAX
    - Prophet
    - LSTM
    - GRU
    - BiLSTM

Todo:

- Decide on the time series data that we will be working on(dataset).
- decide on characteristics of the data, data per day/data per lower time intervals
- Analyse the worldcup98 dataset
- Decide on the model that we will be using. (1 or 2)

> Plan

- Build training and testing modules
- api endpoint to receive csv files
- Train the model if required
- Decide on file format to store weights
- Training capabilities and hyperparameter tuning capabilities for the user
